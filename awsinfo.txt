Before Cloud Computing:

Challenges:
1. Invest Heavily for setup
2. Invest in Resources
3. Scalability
4. Less time to focus on Business

How Cloud Computing Helps?
1. Cloud Computing is Analogous to Electricity Supply.
2. You Pay what you Use.
3. Somebody Else Manages the Services.

What is cloud Computing:
==> Features
1. Pay as you go
2. Scalable
3. Flexible
4. Secure and Disaster Recovery

Cloud Service Models:
1. IaaS (Infrastructure Given):
   In IaaS, i will decide what types of os, network, security everything is decided by developers.
   eg. ec2

2. SaaS (Readymade Software):
   Every is made without anythings is done by developers/
   eg. gmail(Don't know about storage etc).

3. PaaS (Configured Platform):
   Everything a made just to put code and store data.

Cloud Deployment Models:
1. Public
	Public Dataserver (Different company also have data there in Datacenter).    
	Common datacenter.

2. Private
	Where Datacenter which is total private.
	You own that Datacenter
	Critical Data is stored
	Highly costly
	
3. Hybrid
	Private data as well as public data then use Hybrid models.
	Less cheap than private models.
 
4. Community
	When multiple people work from different locations then use community models

Cloud Computing Myths:
1. CC costs job(It will takes job).
2. Cloud is for Techies Alone.
3. CC is Not Safe
4. Cloud is Just for Virtualization(You are using machine).

Cloud Service Providers:
1. AWS
2. AZURE
3. GCP
4. IBM Cloud

AWS and AZURE have some similar service


AWS(Amazon web Service):
